**_This is my personal portfolio website_**

Nothing fancy just a sleek and plain website that I wanted to build for myself to up my design skills.

Feel free to use the design if you want to. Just fork it and you're good to go.

**_Follow these steps to create your own website:_**

- go to supabase and create an account
- create a project and create a table called "users" with the following schema:
  id uuid unique (usually by default)
  header text NOT nullable
  keyword text[] NOT nullable
  description text NOT nullable
  content text NOT nullable

**_Future features are:_**

- a blog (already present but not finished)
- a resume viewer (maybe in a pdf format, let's see...)
